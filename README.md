# Website for everybody!
One of the most common tasks in web development is *refactoring*, I used a template which was messy and refactored the code to make it more simplistic. Ths website is intended for Desktop view only.

## Folder Structure 🗺️:
Inside the "Develop" folder you'll find:
- Assets 
    - Images used for the project
    - CSS Which contains the css file used used for styling.
- index.html which you can run to open the website.
